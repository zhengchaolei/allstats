===================================DotA AllStats Installation Guide===================================

Note: by GHost I mean any variation of GHost++ or GHostOne. Use version 13.2+ for best results.

1) Install and configure a web server and MySQL (Optional) or set up your hosted website.
	If you plan on having >100 games, I recommend installing and using MySQL.
	- MySQL is a true database system, unlike SQLite which is simply a specially formatted file.
	- MySQL is significantly faster than SQLite, and newer versions of GHost will likely have
	  MySQL only features.
	Otherwise, SQLite is easier to setup than MySQL, and for a bot hosting a limited number of games,
	it should work fine.
	
	If installing on your home computer:
		For Windows: Download and install either:
			a) WAMP - http://www.wampserver.com
			b) MoWeS - http://www.chsoftware.net/en/useware/mowes/mowes.htm
		For Linux: Download and install
			a) LAMP - Follow steps at: http://lamphowto.com/
			
		(Optional) Set up DynDNS
			DynDNS is a free service that gives your IP address it's own domain name.
			They have a tray program that can automatically update their site with your IP address.
			If you don't do this, in order for outsiders to view your website, they will have to know
				your IP address.
			Avaliable at: http://www.dyndns.com/
			
	If you plan on using an external hosting provider:
		Plan on using MySQL. Using SQLite is simply not feasible.
		You have 2 configurations for how to set the service up:
			a) Have the website and MySQL database both running on the external host. 
			   Have GHost running on your personal machine.
				-Advantages:
					Having AllStats connect to your MySQL DB will be easy.
					Fast access between AllStats and MySQL - Leads to faster page loads.
				-Disadvantages:
					GHost has to send data to the external MySQL database - Can be slower for GHost
					More difficult to set up - Make sure your provider allows external MySQL access
						Lots of hosting providers will not support this
				
			b) Have the website running on the external host. 
			   Have GHost and MySQL running on your personal machine.
				-Advantages:
					Easier to setup - Will work no matter your hosting provider
				-Disadvantages:
					AllStats won't work if your home computer is off (can't access the database)
					AllStats will be slower since it has to get data from your computer every time. 
		
		If you picked configuration a) all of your MySQL configuration will be done on your hosting site.
		If you picked configuration b) all of your MySQL configuration will be done on your local computer.
			Follow the steps for installing on your home computer as you will need to setup MySQL and,
			ideally have a DynDNS address pointing to your computer.

2) Install and setup GHost++ or GHostOne - Look at http://forum.codelain.com for these programs.
	If using MySQL and MySQL is running on your computer:
		- Set db_type = mysql
		- Set db_mysql_server = localhost
		- Set db_mysql_port = 0 or 3306
	If using MySQL and MySQL is running on a remote computer:
		- Set db_type = mysql
		- Set db_mysql_server = IP of the remote computer
		- Set db_mysql_port = the port specified by your web host
		- Make sure that you have given permission for your local computer to access MySQL or you won't
		  be able to connect.
	Import the appropriate database schema file into your MySQL database
		If using MySQL:
			Navigate to PHPMyAdmin (by default at http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
			Create a GHost database if you haven't already
			Select your GHost database on the left
			Select the import tab
			Click choose file and select the included SQL setup file: (Filenames may change over time)
				mysql_create_tables_v2.3one.sql for GHostOne
				mysql_create_tables_v2.sql for GHost++ 
			Click Import
		If using SQLite:
			This is already done for you.
	MAKE SURE GHOST IS RUNNING CORRECTLY PRIOR TO INSTALLING ALLSTATS
		  
3) Copy AllStats into your web folder. 
	If you're using wamp your web server is named www under your wamp directory.

4) Edit config.php for your settings
	Remember the following: All paths are relative 
	- This means you cannot use something of the format C:\wamp\www
	- Instead, use relative paths - ..\ is used to move up directory trees.
		If you are at C:\wamp\www:
			..\ will refer to the C:\wamp directory
			..\..\ will refer to the C:\ directory
			..\test\ will refer to the C:\wamp\test directory
			..\..\test will refer to the C:\test directory
	If MySQL is running on the same computer as AllStats:
		- Use localhost as your MySQL host
	If MySQL is running on a different computer than AllStats:
		- Use the IP address of the other computer.
			
5) Add tables into your MySQL or SQLite database
	If using MySQL:
		Navigate to PHPMyAdmin (by default at http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
		Create a GHost database if you haven't already
		Select your GHost database on the left
		Select the import tab
		Click choose file and select the MySQLSetup.sql file
		Click Import
	If using SQLite:
		Download SQLite DB Browser
		Open your ghost.dbs file with SQLite DB Browser
			File->Import->Database from SQL file.
			Select your database.
			When asked whether to create a new database, click no.

6) (Optional) Optimize your MySQL database - MySQL only
	Especially with large databases, this will greatly improve the speed of your AllStats website
	Inserts into the database from GHost++ will be slightly slower and your database will take up more room
	- Through the same process as in step 5) import OptimizeMySQL.sql
